Me in the South End area
<br><p>
Personal background:  Moved to Charlotte when I was three.
 I am a middle college student and I started taking CPCC
 courses in 2019. I am the youngest in my family and the 
 only pet I have owned was a betta fish.
 <br>
 </p>
 <p>
Academic background:  I attended all of my schooling in 
Charlotte. I am currently a 13th year A.K.A  super senior 
middle college student because I decided to stay another
 year to finish my degree.  
  </p>
 <br>
  <p>
Background in this subject:  The first time that I was 
exposed to coding was in the 6th grade. I signed up for 
the stem program so that I could take it with my orchestra class. 
I  was able to take multiple courses that gave me a foundation in IT
 and engineering. 
  </p>
 <br>
  <p>
Primary Computer Platform:  My main computer platform consists of
 whatever I am assigned to do for classes. I am most proficient 
 with the Windows platform.
