 courses in 2019. I am the youngest in my family and the

year to finish my degree.</li>
 
 <li>Background in this subject:  The first time that I was 
exposed to coding was in the 6th grade. I signed up for 
the stem program so that I could take it with my orchestra class. 
I was able to take multiple courses that gave me a foundation in IT
and engineering.</li>
